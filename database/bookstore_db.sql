The iconic timepiece, probably the single most sought-after watch in the world, is now in the possession of his daughter Clea, who wears it every day in his memory. Franklin Roosevelt wore an elegant gold Tiffany watch, gifted to him by a friend on his birthday, to the famous Yalta Conference where he shook the hands of Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill. JFK\'s Omega worn to his presidential inauguration, Ralph Lauren\'s watch purchased from Andy Warhol\'s personal collection, Sir Edmund Hillary\'s Rolex worn during the first-ever summit of Mt. Everest . . . these and many more compose the stories of the world\'s most coveted watches captured in A Man and His Watch. Matthew Hranek, a watch collector and NYC men\'s style fixture, has traveled the world conducting firsthand interviews and diving into exclusive collections to gather the never-before-told stories of 76 watches, completed with stunning original photography of every single piece. Through these intimate accounts and Hranek\'s storytelling, the watches become more than just timepieces and status symbols; they represent historical moments, pioneering achievements, heirlooms, family mementos, gifts of affection, and lifelong friendships.', '50.00', '2023-01-07 18:16:16'),

Found in schoolbooks from Alaska to Singapore, the poem has been stitched, stamped, quilted, set to music, printed on cards, written on cakes, and made into films.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, \'Warning\' appears as an illustrated book with drawings by Pythia Ashton-Jewell specially designed to suit its unique character.', '75.00', '2023-01-07 18:50:09'),
